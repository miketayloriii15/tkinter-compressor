# File Compression App

This is a simple desktop app I made with Python and Tkinter. It compresses and decompresses text files using zlib and base64. The interface is clean and easy to use, and the app handles everything through a basic GUI.

## Features

- Compress text files with one click
- Decompress back to original text
- Clean, minimal Tkinter interface
- Uses zlib for compression and base64 for encoding

## Tech Used

- Python 3
- Tkinter (GUI)
- zlib + base64 (for compression logic)
